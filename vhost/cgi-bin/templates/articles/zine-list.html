		<p>In the very beginning <b>ARK</b> never really had a Fan Club, more 
		  a gathering of local fans, but as their gigs started to extend beyond 
		  the Black Country more and more fans started writing to the band, at 
		  this point Richard &quot;Raps&quot; Stone offered to start up an <b>ARK</b> 
		  Fan Club, known as <i>The Family</i>. The initial newsletters, called 
		  <i>The Teller</i> after the early <b>ARK</b> song, helped to advertise 
		  gigs and keep fans in touch with what the band were doing. If you have
      copies of these early newsletters, please get in touch as I would like
      to include these too in the future.</p>
		<p>By 1989 the mailing list had grown to a few hundred fans across the UK
      and mainland Europe. At this point the band took over writing the 
      newsletter themsleves, renaming it <i>The Family</i> after the Fan Club
      itself. However, they soon realised what a task it was, and Dan The 
      Youth, and later Barbie, took to editing the newsletter. Initially this 
      contained a brief announcement of all things <b>ARK</b>, but eventually 
      grew into a neat little info booklet. </p>
		<p>The final newsletter (issue #10) was released in June 1994, with an 
		  incomplete interview with the band. When time permits the full 
      transcription of the interview will be included once I upload the final 
      newsletter. </p>
		<p> I shall upload the newsletters periodically (with additional liner 
		  notes, where appropriate). In addition, where appropriate, I'll aim to 
      provide both an original graphic version and a textual version of
      newsletters.</p>
